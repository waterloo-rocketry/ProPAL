Analysis scripts and utilities for the team's rocket propulsion development efforts

Currently, just run test.py for the most recent tank blowdown model. It is determined to be up to the same level of functionality as that of Rick Newlands' script, which is what the code is based off. Support for liquid and solid engine simulation is an active work in progress.

- modify EtOH_tank to change params from NOS_tank
- modify sim_burn to simplify logic for liquid
- modify thermochemical data for nos/etoh
- obtain and verify data against irl
